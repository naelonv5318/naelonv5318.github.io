In class this week, we started to make our flag project.
///<p>include image</p>
<p>size = 100</p>
<p>width = size * 3</p>
<p>hight = size * 2</p>
<p>rectangle(width,hight / 6, "solid", "white")</p>
<p>rectangle(width,hight,"solid","red")</p>
<p>triangle(hight / 1,"solid","blue")</p>
<p>star(hight / 4.5,"solid","white")</p>
<p> puerto_rico = rectangle(width,hight,"solid","red")</p>///
